MetaAttack is a research project focused on inaudible attacks using ultrasonic waves. 
The code in this project primarily introduces a feedback algorithm for MetaAttack, which helps attackers determine whether the attack was successful.
The feedback code needs to be used in conjunction with iwlist.
To achieve optimal attack performance, this algorithm should be used in conjunction with the attack device described in the paper "A Portable and Stealthy Inaudible Voice Attack Based on Acoustic Metamaterials."
